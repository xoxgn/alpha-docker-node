# alpha-docker-node
ALPHA: Docker + Node.js

## Hot-reloading
To get hot-reloading during development, the `nodemon` package can be used instead of `node`.

The command to run the app image as a container would be as follows:
 - `docker compose up -d`

 To stop it, and all its other peripheral services, the command would be:
 - `docker compose down`
